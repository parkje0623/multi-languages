1. Do: the returned type after the call operator is used must be Send.
Why: We used Arc<T> for thread safe sharable ownership, so T must implement Send as well.

2. .shutdown suggests using drain(..) method because we want to remove all pending tasks in the queue, not just iterating through the queue.
Also, drain(..) yields the removed item (leaving allocation untouched) so that worker threads can be waited to finish and ensure they have exited by calling JoinHandle's .join method.

3. Arc<T> is thread safe to have multiple ownership of the same data, and does not provide thread safety of the data.
Therefore, Block must be cloned to have sharable (multiple) ownership of Block to be thread safe.
